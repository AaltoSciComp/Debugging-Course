# How to Debug Code - An Overview

Every coder makes mistakes, and finding out why code isn't working (or not working as intended) can be time consuming. This course tries to introduce tools and methods to help users with debugging and potentially optimising their code. It introduces common pitfalls of different languages and provides practical exercises in which bugs have to be found and fixed. It is completely modular, each day a different language will be introduced and tools and specifics for that language presented. Due to the structure of the course, there might be overlapping information between the individual days as each day focuses on one particular language.
The course is designed for students and researchers who have a basic background in programming (i.e. they should be familiar with concepts like variables, loops, if/then/else and functions), but are either new to a language or are starting their first projects. More specific requirements (including required software) will be listed for each day. 

## Parts of the Course

### Day 1: Debugging in Python


### Day 2: Debugging in Matlab (Presenter: Thomas Pfau)

**Prerequesites**:  
Software: Installed Matlab 2021b including the Mapping toolbox.  
Skills: Basic understanding of Matlab (Essentially what is taught in our Matlab Basics Course [here](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/eglerean/matlabcourse/-/tree/master/AY20212022/MatlabBasics2021))

**Content**:
This module will give an overview of basic matlab concepts, common errors (and error-messages) how to read and interpret these error messages and provide a variety of exercises to make allow you to use the tools introduced and get some experience with them.
